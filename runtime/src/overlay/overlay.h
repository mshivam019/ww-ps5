// In-game settings overlay (Dear ImGui), drawn on top of the TV window's picture by both renderers.
//
// F1 opens and closes it (Esc closes); on macOS also Cmd+, (app menu > Settings...; most Mac keyboards
// send F1 only with Fn unless the top row is set to standard function keys); on a controller, hold Select/Minus for half a second or press
// Home. While it is open the game sees no buttons (it keeps running) and the overlay takes keyboard,
// mouse and controller. Tabs: Saves, Graphics, Display, Mods, Controls, Language / About. Every option
// calls the same functions as the macOS menu bar (which stays in sync) or the SDL host's shortcuts.
// When the game asks for text, the overlay shows its text prompt (text_entry.h) with the same input rules.
//
// Threads: hosts feed input on their main thread; the renderer builds and draws the UI on its render
// thread once per TV present (frame()); option changes go back to the main thread (hostui::post).
//
// Test switches:
//   WWHD_TEST_OVERLAY=open[:<tab>][@<frame>]   open the overlay (tab: saves, graphics, display, mods,
//                                              controls, about) at TV frame <frame> (default 1)
//   WWHD_TEST_OVERLAY=perf                     only the performance overlay
